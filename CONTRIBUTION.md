* Write meaningful commit messages (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:` etc.).
* Always test before submitting.

## 🌌 Data Contribution

When contributing astronomical or launch data:

* Include a **source** (official agency, observatory, or verified API).
* Use **UTC** for timestamps.
* Keep JSON clean, properly structured, and validated.
* Avoid speculative or unconfirmed data.
